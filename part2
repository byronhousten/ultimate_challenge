1. Since this experiment is looking to encourage drivers to drive in both cities, the measures of success need to measure the change in drivers operating in both cities. Depending how the current behavior of drivers, this can be measured a couple ways:
    - increase in number of drivers who serve the neighboring
    - increase in number of trips per driver in the neighboring city
    
2. Due to the complementary circadian rhythms of the cities, I would implement this experiment on weekends when there is reasonable activity in both cities. This should help in eliminating any driver biases due to operating during a specific time of day. I would want to run this experiment for at least two weekends to get enough data. I would want to measure the two things stated above. The increase in number of drivers who pick up atleast one trip in the neighboring city to indicate how much the reimbursement encouraged new drivers to serve in the neighboring city. The increase in number of trips per driver in the neighboring city will indicate how much the reimbursement encouraged drivers who already served the neighboring city to increase their operations there. I would test to see if there is a statistically significant change in the number of drivers operating in the neighboring cities as well as if there is a statistically significant change in the increase in number of trips by drivers in neighboring cities. Statistically significant results would lead to a positive recommendation towards reimbursing toll costs. Caveats would include there was no testing done on the weekdays - do not know if driver behavior is different on weekdays over weekends.
